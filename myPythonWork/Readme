#Calling python fuctions from c
Reference: https://docs.python.org/release/2.6.5/extending/embedding.html#pure-embedding
/*Embedding Python in C*/

The first program aims to execute a function in a Python script. 
Like in the section about the very high level interface, the Python interpreter does not directly interact
with the application.
The code is to run a function defined in a python script called - "Call"
This is a tutorial I tried with calling python functions from c

1. Such extension modules can do two things that canâ€™t be done directly in 
Python: they can implement new built-in object types, and they can call C library functions and system calls.

2. The Python API is incorporated in a C source file by including the header "Python.h".
